The ATM typescript project is a software program that emulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It is designed to run in a command-line interface, where users interact with the program by entering commands, similar to how they would use an actual ATM. The core logic of this program closely mirrors the operations of a real ATM machine, but it operates in isolation without being connected to a physical database.
To make the program user-friendly and interactive, it leverages two essential libraries: 'Inquirer' and 'Chalk.' Inquirer facilitates user input by presenting a series of questions and options in a structured and interactive manner. Users can select from available options, such as checking their account balance,and  making withdrawals. Chalk is used to enhance the visual presentation of the command-line interface, allowing for the use of colors and styles to provide a visually appealing and intuitive command line experience
The ATM project aims to replicate the essential features of an ATM machine, providing users with a virtual banking experience within the command-line environment. While it doesn't connect to an actual database, it can simulate various account actions and provide feedback to users based on their inputs.
